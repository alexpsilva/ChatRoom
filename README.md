This project consists of a simple chat room interface. It requires TkInter to be installed and is split into 2 separate applications: 
 - The client, that displays the chat room, all current messages and allows sending new ones to the server
 - The server, that receives messages from all clients and brodcasts new ones whenever they arrive
